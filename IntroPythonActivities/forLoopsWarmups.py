# 2. What is the difference between a FOR loop and a WHILE loop?
# Provide two (2) examples of each. 

# For loop repeats numbers in a sequence, while loops keeps repeating numbers as long as the condition is True
# For loop runs a specific amount of times, while loop can only run off a condition

# 3. Create a FOR loop that will go through a list of names 
# and print all the names that start with the letter "R".

names=['Michael','Rebecca','William','Kareem','Robert','Rose','Jason']
